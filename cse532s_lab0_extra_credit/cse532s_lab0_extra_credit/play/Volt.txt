22 Most fair return of greetings and desires. 
23 Upon our first, he sent out to suppress 
24 His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd 
25 To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack; 
26 But, better look'd into, he truly found 
27 It was against your highness; whereat griev'd,-- 
28 That so his sickness, age, and impotence 
29 Was falsely borne in hand,--sends out arrests 
30 On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys; 
31 Receives rebuke from Norway; and, in fine, 
32 Makes vow before his uncle never more 
33 To give th' assay of arms against your majesty. 
34 Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy, 
35 Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee; 
36 And his commission to employ those soldiers, 
37 So levied as before, against the Polack: 
38 With an entreaty, herein further shown, 
39 That it might please you to give quiet pass 
40 Through your dominions for this enterprise, 
41 On such regards of safety and allowance 
42 As therein are set down.
