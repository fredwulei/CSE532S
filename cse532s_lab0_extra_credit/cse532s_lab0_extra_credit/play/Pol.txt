1 Th' ambassadors from Norway, my good lord, 
2 Are joyfully return'd.
4 Have I, my lord? Assure you, my good liege, 
5 I hold my duty, as I hold my soul, 
6 Both to my God and to my gracious king: 
7 And I do think,--or else this brain of mine 
8 Hunts not the trail of policy so sure 
9 As it hath us'd to do,--that I have found 
10 The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
12 Give first admittance to the ambassadors; 
13 My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
