9 So much from the understanding of himself, 
35 Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
14 Some little time: so by your companies 
6 Since nor the exterior nor the inward man 
12 And since so neighbour'd to his youth and humour, 
15 To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather, 
11 That, being of so young days brought up with him, 
7 Resembles that it was. What it should be, 
2 Moreover that we much did long to see you, 
10 I cannot dream of: I entreat you both 
8 More than his father's death, that thus hath put him 
16 So much as from occasion you may glean, 
1 Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern! 
5 Of Hamlet's transformation; so I call it, 
4 Our hasty sending. Something have you heard 
3 The need we have to use you did provoke 
18 That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
17 Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus, 
13 That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
