36 Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz: 
42 Ay, amen!
23 As to expend your time with us awhile, 
24 For the supply and profit of our hope, 
39 And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
22 To show us so much gentry and good-will 
38 My too-much-changed son.--Go, some of you, 
25 Your visitation shall receive such thanks 
20 And sure I am two men there are not living 
37 And I beseech you instantly to visit 
26 As fits a king's remembrance.
21 To whom he more adheres. If it will please you 
19 Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you,
